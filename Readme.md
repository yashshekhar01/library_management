## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

### Backend
- **Java**: Core programming language for business logic and operations.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework for mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing data.

### Architecture
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: 
  - **Model**: Represents the entities like `Book`, `Member`, and `BorrowRecord`.
  - **DAO Layer**: Handles database operations using Hibernate.
  - **Service Layer**: Implements business logic for managing library operations.
  - **UI**: Console-based, menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## How to Run the Project ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VarunPratapChauhan/HibernateLibraryProject.git
   cd HibernateLibraryProject
   
2.  **Set up the database:**

Install MySQL and create a database named "hiber_lib".
Run the following SQL script to create and use hiber_lib and don't worry about tables, they will create automatically when we run the application:

```
create DATABASE hiber_lib;
use hiber_lib;
```

3.  **Configure Hibernate:**

Update the hibernate.cfg.xml file with your MySQL credentials:
```
<property name="connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hiber_lib</property>
<property name="connection.username">your-username</property>
<property name="connection.password">your-password</property>
```
4.  **Run the application:**

Compile and run the App.java file using your favorite IDE or terminal:
```
javac App.java
java App
```
